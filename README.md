# arrow

The arrow framework is a lightweight BPMN 2.0 framework based on a graph database and the reactive programming framework Akka. The underlying graph database persistence layer is flexible and therefore it is possible to exchange the persistence provider. At the moment the Neo4j graph database is supported.
